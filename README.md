Depth estimation is the task of measuring the distance of each pixel relative to the camera. This repo contains implementations of the [Depth-Anything](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything) monocular depth estimation model in both C++ and Python. It utilizes the TensorRT API to enable efficient real-time inference.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance

The inference time includes the pre-preprocessing and post-processing stages:
| Device          | Model | Model Input (WxH) |  Image Resolution (WxH)     | Inference Time(ms) |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| RTX4090        | `Depth-Anything-S`  |518x518  |  1280x720    | 3     |
| RTX4090        | `Depth-Anything-B`  |518x518  |  1280x720    | 6     |
| RTX4090        | `Depth-Anything-L`  |518x518  |  1280x720    | 12     |

> [!NOTE]  
> The inference was conducted using `FP16` precision, with a warm-up period of 10 frames, and the reported time corresponds to the last inference.
